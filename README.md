# Sales-Data-Analysis-and-Reporting-System

Designed and developed a MySQL-based sales database with structured tables
(`products`, `customers`, `sales`) and enforced data integrity using constraints like
`FOREIGN KEY`, `CHECK`, and `AUTO_INCREMENT`.
Implemented ETL pipeline using Python (Pandas, SQLAlchemy) to extract, clean,
transform, and load sales data from Excel into MySQL, ensuring data consistency and
accuracy.
Performed advanced SQL queries to analyze total revenue, top-selling products,
customer demographics, and payment trends, providing actionable business insights.
Created interactive dashboards and reports using Matplotlib and Seaborn, including
pie charts, bar charts, and line graphs to visualize sales trends.
Optimized database performance by indexing foreign keys and using `JOIN`
operations to efficiently query large datasets, improving reporting speed.
Developed SQL views and stored procedures to streamline reporting tasks and
enhance data retrieval for business analysis.
